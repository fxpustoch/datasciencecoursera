README.md : You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. 
This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

To run the analysis, run the run_analysis.R script. If you don't have the folder, uncomment the download and unzip part
of the code. The program will generate the tidyData.csv file at the end.

Here is the functionality of the program (detailed in CodeBook.md)

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
